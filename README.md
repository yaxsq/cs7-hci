# Krave Mart Redesign - HCI Project

A comprehensive redesign of the Krave Mart grocery shopping application, focusing on improving usability, accessibility, and user experience through evidence-based design principles.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project addresses critical usability deficiencies identified in the original Krave Mart application through a complete redesign grounded in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) principles. The redesign targets key pain points including visual cognitive overload, poor product discovery, and friction in financial workflows.

## ✨ Key Design Improvements

### 🎨 Visual & Interface Design
- **High-Contrast Dark Mode**: Improved legibility and reduced eye strain
- **Minimalist Layout**: Eliminated promotional clutter and visual noise
- **Universal Iconography**: Intuitive category navigation using recognizable icons
- **Consistent Typography**: Improved readability and visual hierarchy

### 🔍 Enhanced Navigation & Discovery

- **Platform**: Cross-platform (iOS & Android)
- **State Management**: Provider/Riverpod

## 📊 Design Process

### Phase 1: Research & Analysis
- User surveys and interviews
- Task analysis and usability testing
- Identification of core friction points

### Phase 2a: Prototype Design
- High-fidelity Figma prototypes
- Design rationale based on HCI principles
- Accessibility-focused feature planning

### Phase 2b: Implementation & Evaluation
- Functional application development
- Multi-method usability testing
- Quantitative and qualitative validation

## 🎓 HCI Principles Applied

This redesign incorporates established HCI principles including:
- **Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics**
- **Cognitive Load Reduction**
- **Recognition Over Recall**
- **Consistency and Standards**
- **Error Prevention**
- **Flexibility and Efficiency of Use**

## 📱 Target User Groups

The redesign specifically addresses needs of diverse user segments:
- **Senior Citizens**: High-legibility mode and simplified workflows
- **Visually Impaired**: High contrast and text-to-speech
- **Motor Impaired**: Large touch targets and extended timing
- **Low-Literacy Users**: Icon-based navigation and Urdu support

## 📈 Performance Metrics

Based on usability testing:
- **Task Completion Time**: Reduced from 4+ minutes to under 42 seconds
- **Error Rate**: Decreased by 85% for specially-abled users
- **User Satisfaction**: SUS scores improved from 55 to 92 for normal users
